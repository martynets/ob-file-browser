This directory contains the ob-file-browser version 1.0.

The ob-file-browser is Openbox pipe menu file system browser. It represents
filesystem tree as submenus tree, files and directories by their names and icons
and executes viewing command for the selected file.

The file browser is designed to operate even in a desktop agnostic environments.
It does not rely on neither any desktop specific configuration manager (e.g.
gconf) nor tools which may fall back to them (e.g. xdg-utils). Instead it
gathers all needed information directly from system wide and user specific
configuration files based on freedesktop.org specifications.

The menu generated contains direct viewing commands of user preferred
applications and uses icon files from current icon theme.

If a file of unknown MIME type is selected or there is no viewing application
installed for such a type then user preferred file manager is executed to
interact with the user and select a suitable application.

This script processes file names with weird symbols correctly except the new
line symbol.

Software Requirements
---------------------

This package uses bash specific extensions and requires bash shell version 4+.
It calls file tool and thus depends on the file package.
The file browser uses xdg-bash-functions package which is included as the
subtree. Please see its README file for additional software requirements.

Downloading
-----------

Current version of ob-file-browser can be downloaded from the link below:

  https://github.com/martynets/ob-file-browser/archive/1.0.zip

The latest version can be checked here:

  https://github.com/martynets/ob-file-browser/releases/latest

The ob-file-browser package is also available via Git access from the GitHub
server:

  https://github.com/martynets/ob-file-browser.git

Installation
------------

This script is the Openbox pipe menu and needs to be installed as per the
Openbox requirements. It can be copied to any convenient location and reference
to it must be added to Openbox menu file which name and location default to
$HOME/.config/openbox/menu.xml. Something similar to the following must be
added:

    <menu id="ob_file_browser" label="File System Browser"
        execute="/path/to/script/ob-file-browser"
            icon="/path/to/icontheme/places/16/folder.svg"/>

The script receives one optional argument - path to the starting subdirectory.
Such an argument may be added to the execute command in the example above. If no
argument passed the script starts from the root directory.
More information on Openbox menu configuration can be found on its wiki page:

  http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Menus

Note that path to the xdg-bash-functions package is hardcoded in the script and
they both must be located in the same directory.

Configuration
-------------

The file browser script can be configured via two instances of the configuration
file named ob-file-browser.conf. The first instance is located in the
same directory with the script and is considered as the system wide settings.
The second one is located in "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME" path and is considered as the
user specific settings. The latter overrides settings of the former. Both, only
one of them or none may be used depending on what suits the need best.

The files are sourced by the script and thus must conform to the bash shell
syntax.

The files consist mostly of the xdg-bash-functions' customizable variables and
define some XDG defaults and preferences. For more information see comments
inside the sample configuration file and appropriate freedesktop.org
specifications.

There are two settings (variables) there specific to the file browser:

    - SHOW_HIDDEN - it defines whether hidden files and directories are
      shown in the menu tree (true) or are excluded (any other value).

    - SLOW_SYSTEM - dramatically increases the script performance if set to
      true. The side effect of this value is that all text files are not tested
      for their exact MIME types and are reported as application/octet-stream.
      For the end user this means that these files will be represented by the
      default icon (application-x-executable icon in most cases) and once
      selected passed to the default file manager to handle. The last one most
      probably will examine the exact MIME type and pass the file to a suitable
      application.

In fact the last one option allows to decrease the time the call to file tool
takes on directories with big amount of text files (e.g. /etc) or huge amount of
files at all (e.g. /usr/bin). Additionally Openbox needs some extra time to
process the pipe menu with, say, thousands of items. But if such directories are
not in the interests or the performance of the target system is quite high it is
advised to have the setting set to false (default value) to keep full
functionality of the script.

Default applications
--------------------

In a desktop specific environment this script may confuse by weird selection of
default applications (e.g. Audacious as the default file manager or LibreOffice
Writer as default plain text editor). This is caused by missing proper settings
in freedesktop.org configuration files. Instead all settings are managed by a
specific desktop configuration manager.

To resolve this issue preferred applications must be set in mimeapps.list files.
Unfortunately mimeapps.list files are usually almost empty. If the script does
not find the user preferred application it uses the first found one from
mimeinfo.cache or from mailcap files. These files are maintained by
desktop-file-utils and mime-support packages respectively. The order in which
applications are listed depends on set of applications installed on the target
system and internal algorithms of the mentioned packages. It is ill-advised to
manually edit these files as they will get overwritten at next package install
or uninstall operation.

Normally preferred applications are set from the file manager. But sometimes
manual editing of the files might be the best way. In the above case something
similar to the following needs to be added to $HOME/.config/mimeapps.list file:

    [Default Applications]
    inode/directory=spacefm.desktop
    text/plain=leafpad.desktop

specification on:
